  <p class="tagline">This <em>creamy</em> chicken pesto pasta is not only easy to make, it will also result in very little cleanup as it uses just <strong>ONE POT</strong>.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound chicken breast</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp Butter</li>
    <li>2 cloves Garlic</li>
    <li>8 oz Penne Pasta</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups Chicken Broth</li>
    <li>1 cup Milk</li>
    <li>3 oz Cream Cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Grated Parmesan</li>
    <li>freshly cracked pepper</li>
    <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>(Optional) 3 cup Spinach</li>
    <li>(Optional) 1/4 cup sliced Sun-Dried Tomatoes</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the <span>chicken breast</span> into 1-inch pieces. Add the <span>butter</span> to a deep skillet and melt over medium heat. Add the <span>chicken</span> to the skillet and cook over medium heat until the <span>chicken</span> is slightly browned on the outside.</li>
    <li>While the <span>chicken</span> is cooking, mince the <span>garlic</span>. Add the <span>garlic</span> to the skillet with the <span>chicken</span> and continue to saut√© for one minute more.</li>
    <li>Add the uncooked <span>pasta</span> and <span>chicken broth</span> to the skillet with the <span>chicken</span> and <span>garlic</span>. Stir to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
    <li>Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring the <span>broth</span> up to a boil.</li>
    <li>Once the <span>broth</span> comes to a full boil, give the <span>pasta</span> a quick stir, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the <span>pasta</span> simmer over medium-low heat for about 8 minutes, or until the <span>pasta</span> is tender and most of the <span>broth</span> has been absorbed. Stir the <span>pasta</span> briefly every two minutes as it simmers, replacing the lid quickly each time.</li>
    <li>Once the <span>pasta</span> is tender and most of the <span>broth</span> absorbed, add the <span>milk</span>, <span>cream cheese</span> (cut into chunks), and <span>pesto</span>. Stir and cook over medium heat until the <span>cream cheese</span> has fully melted into the sauce. Finally, add the <span>grated parmesan cheese</span> and stir until combined.</li>
    <li>If using, add the fresh <span>spinach</span> and sliced <span>sun dried tomatoes</span>. Stir until the <span>spinach</span> has wilted, then remove the <span>pasta</span> from the heat. Top the <span>pasta</span> with <span>freshly cracked pepper</span> and a pinch of <span>crushed red pepper</span>, then serve.</li>
