  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 1/2 pounds Bone-In Pork Shoulder</li>
    <li>2 Tsp Salt</li>
    <li>1 Tsp fres ground Pepper</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp Cooking Oil</li>
    <li>1 Medium Onion (yellow or white)</li>
    <li>4 cloves Garlic</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp Tomato Paste</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp Chili Powder</li>
    <li>2 Tsp Ground Cumin</li>
    <li>1 Cup Water</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>For Serving:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bread Rolls</li>
    <li>Coleslaw</li>
    <li>Pickles</li>
    <li>BBQ Sauce (Homemade or Store-Bought)</li>
    <li>Hot Sauce</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Rub the <span>pork</span> with <span>salt</span> and <span>pepper</span>, and then set aside while you prepare the remaining ingredients. </li>
    <li>Heat oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add the <span>onions</span> and <span>garlic</span> then cook, occasionally stirring, until they are sweet and browned around the edges.</li>
    <li>Stir in the <span>tomato paste</span>, <span>chili powder</span>, and <span>cumin</span>. Cook, stirring until the <span>tomato paste</span> turns from bright red to orange in color; about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the <span>water</span>, <span>apple cider vinegar</span>, and <span>fish sauce</span> and cook for about 1 minute, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Rest the <span>seasoned pork</span> in the bottom of a slow cooker then pour the <span>onion and spice mixture</span> on top. Wiggle the <span>pork</span> around the bottom of the slow cooker so that some of the <span>onion and spice mixture</span> slides underneath.</li>
    <li>Cover with lid and cook until the <span>pork</span> can be easily shredded; <strong>LOW</strong> for 6 to 8 hours or <strong>HIGH</strong> for 4 to 6 hours.</li>
    <li>Turn off the slow cooker and transfer the <span>pork</span> to a cutting board. If the <span>pork</span> has a bone in it, remove and discard it. Use two forks to shred the meat, discarding any connective tissue, and large clumps of fat.</li>
    <li>Remove the <span>cooking liquid</span> and skim most of the fat from its surface. Discard the fat then set the <span>cooking liquid</span> aside.</li>
    <li>If using <span>barbecue sauce</span>, add it to the slow cooker and stir in the <span>shredded pork</span>. For even more flavor, add back some of the reserved <span>cooking liquid</span>. If youâ€™re not using <span>barbecue sauce</span>, add the <span>shredded pork</span> and the cooking liquid back to the slow cooker.</li> 
    <li>Taste and season with <span>salt</span>, additional <span>vinegar</span>, or <span>hot sauce</span> as needed.</li>
  </ol>
